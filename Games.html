            <p>Helldivers 2, now one of my favorite games is fun just because of the pure madness and insanity of the game.
            In this cooperative PvE game, you play as a soldier for the sattirically capitalist planet of Super-Earth. There are 
            multiple mission types in the game, such as killing bugs and bots, and the goal for each is to extract safely.
            One of the key mechanics in the game is to call down "strategems" from your mothership. What you can call down can range from
            supplies, to a nuclear bomb. Another feature of the game is that it's a collaborative effort of your army to liberate the 
            galaxy. I would rate this game an 9/10 and would reccomend to anybody.
